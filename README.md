# Line Reader Program with File Descriptor - 42Cursus--Get-next-line

This repository contains a program built with C, Makefile, file descriptors, and Shell that reads a line ending with a newline 
from a file descriptor. The program utilizes these technologies to efficiently read and process data from a file descriptor using 
low-level I/O operations.

Technologies Used

C
C is a powerful programming language known for its efficiency and low-level control. It provides direct access to memory and system 
resources, making it suitable for systems programming. In this project, C is used to implement the line reader program and perform 
file I/O operations.

Makefile
Makefile is a build automation tool used to compile and build software projects. It allows defining dependencies, compiling rules, 
and automating the build process. In this project, Makefile is used to compile the C program and generate the executable.

File Descriptor
A file descriptor is an abstract indicator used to access files or input/output resources in Unix-like operating systems. 
It represents an open file or a communication endpoint. In this project, file descriptors are used to read lines from a given file 
descriptor, enabling efficient data processing.

Shell
Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks using command-line interpreters. It provides a scripting language to execute commands, 
manipulate files, and perform various system operations. In this project, Shell scripting is used to run and control the execution of 
the line reader program.
